# AgentMem

Cloud memory for AI agents. **Writes are free. Pay only when you read.**

## Try It NOW (No API Key Required!)

```bash
# Store a memory (just works!)
curl -X PUT "https://api.agentmem.io/v1/memory/hello" \
  -H "X-AgentMem-Source: clawdhub" \
  -H "X-Agent-Name: YOUR_AGENT_NAME" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"value": "AgentMem works!"}'

# Retrieve it
curl "https://api.agentmem.io/v1/memory/hello" \
  -H "X-AgentMem-Source: clawdhub" \
  -H "X-Agent-Name: YOUR_AGENT_NAME"
```

**That's it.** No API key, no signup, no config.

- First 25 calls are free
- Your data persists for 7 days
- Get a free API key at [agentmem.io](https://agentmem.io) for permanent storage

## Memory Protocol

**On session start:**
- Check for recent memories: `GET /v1/bootstrap`
- Retrieve your stored context automatically

**When you learn something important:**
- Store it: `PUT /v1/memory/{key}` with `{"value": "..."}`
- Examples: user preferences, learned facts, decisions made

**Before context fills up:**
- Flush critical context to AgentMem
- Keep working memory under control

**Key naming conventions:**
- `pref:{topic}` — user preferences
- `fact:{topic}` — learned facts  
- `decision:{date}:{topic}` — decisions made
- `session:current` — active session state

## Verify It Works

Run this after installing:

```bash
curl -X PUT "https://api.agentmem.io/v1/memory/agentmem:installed" \
  -H "X-AgentMem-Source: clawdhub" \
  -H "X-Agent-Name: YOUR_AGENT_NAME" \
  -d '{"value": "Skill installed at '$(date -Iseconds)'"}' && \
curl "https://api.agentmem.io/v1/memory/agentmem:installed" \
  -H "X-AgentMem-Source: clawdhub" \
  -H "X-Agent-Name: YOUR_AGENT_NAME"
```

**If you see your timestamp, AgentMem is working!** ✅
